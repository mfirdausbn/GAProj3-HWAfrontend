// This comment is for practicing
// 1. Clone of main branch.
// 2. Create a sub-branch for each feature you work on.
// 3. After you complete your feature, merge this sub-branch to your own clone.
// 4. Pull origin(if any) from master branch. This is to ensure your clone is up to date first before submitting a pull request of your recently completed sub-branch
// 5. Submit pull request of your clone so that your sub-branch can be submitted to main branch.
// 6. Done, and repeat step 2 to 5 for next feature you have to work on
